## About

The UnityEngine uses a GUID system to uniquely identify objects across executions. However, this implementation is not accessible at runtime.
This package implements a custom GUID system to uniquely identify objects across executions without the need for any custom component attached to the objects.
The registries need to be updated in the editor before the application is built. New objects created at runtime will get a randomly generated GUID assigned to them.

## Installation

In the Unity Package Manager, click the `+` button and `Add package from git URL...` then enter the URL of this repository: `https://github.com/liris-xr/Unity-Runtime-GUID.git`.

## Usage

Example scripts are available in the [samples directory](Samples~/) of the project.

### Automatically update the registries

If you want GUID that are consistent across executions, you need to generate them before running your application through the Unity Editor.
To do so, from an editor script, update the registries using the `GuidRegistryUpdater`. For instance on pre-build or before entering play mode in the editor.

See an example [here](Samples~/CustomRegistryUpdater.cs).

### Access the GUIDs at runtime

You can access the GUIDs in the registries at runtime from anywhere in your application. If you try to get a GUID for an object not present in the registry, a new entry will be automatically generated with a random GUID.

See an example [here](Samples~/RuntimeGuidAccess.cs).

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/liris-xr/Unity-Runtime-GUID/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and
known issues).
